###  How to download and install Galerio Beta

Simply download the Galerio.zip file from this repository [Direct Link](https://github.com/manuelvrhovac/galerio/raw/master/Galerio.zip) and then extract Galerio.app to your Applications folder. 

> ‚ò¢Ô∏è Currently the app is **not signed/notarized with my Developer Certificate** so you will get the *"App can‚Äôt be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"* message. 
> ‚öôÔ∏è Open **Preferences > Security & Privacy > General** and allow it from there. This issue will be fixed as soon as I renew my developer certificate.

Please use 'Send Feedback' to inform me about any bugs or features that you'd like to see added.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è  Known issues

Galerio doesn't play well with iCloud Drive - if "**Optimise Mac Storage**" is turned on, Galerio won't be able to read files that are not downloaded completely. This should be fixed in the next version.

#### üóì  Expiration date
This beta version (0.9.1) will stop working after Nov 1st 2019.
